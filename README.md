# Optimal joint functional split and network functionplacement in virtualized RAN with splittable flows

## Description
This repository aims to demonstrate the Multi-path functional Split and network function placement in virtualized RAN (*MuSt-RAN*) model implementation. We tested in Ubuntu Server 18.04 and Ubuntu 20.04, with Python 3.6.9, docplex 2.20.204 for implement the optimization model and IBM CPLEX 12.8.0.
